1. to run Community_detection.py type - `./Community_detection.py data_n/`    , where data_n is the directory containing graph edges
2. to run plot_graph.py, type -  `./plot_graph.py  data_n/ result_files/ large_data/` where result_files contains output of the first program and large_data/ contains the files having large number of nodes.

plot : while plotting the graph, I discarded the communities (more precisely, picture-sharing graph between usres in same/diffrent communities) having less than 5 nodes. It's "community-strength" vs "number of such communities" graph.
