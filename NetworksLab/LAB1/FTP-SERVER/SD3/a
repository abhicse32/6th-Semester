Okay...So, here I begin to explain myself..I always look forward to make friends each and every moments in my life..I don't want to hurt anyone but still due to my comedy sort of nature sometimes I find people get hurt due to some words thrown by me...Whihc feels quite worse and I feel sorry for all such incident
