Four days after it censured Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal for violation of the Model Code of Conduct and asked him to be more circumspect in his public utterances, the Election Commission on Tuesday told him to “desist” from making such statements, failing which it would be “constrained to take stern action” against him.
The EC was referring to Mr Kejriwal’s exhorting voters in his election speeches for the Delhi assembly to take bribes if offered by the BJP and Congress but to vote for his AAP.
