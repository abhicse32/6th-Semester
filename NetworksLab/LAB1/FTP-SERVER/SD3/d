"Today we came to the EC to complain against Kejriwal for misleading the people of Delhi,” Delhi BJP chief Satish Upadhyay told journalists,
“by accusing parties of bribing voters. We have demanded cancellation of his candidature and banning him from giving any speech.”
Simultaneously, the Congress' Kiran Walia asked the EC to remove Mr Kejriwal’s name from the electoral rolls and bar him from contesting elections.
After resigning as CM, Mr Kejriwal had shifted from Tilak Lane to Kaushambi (Ghaziabad), but Ms Walia said, he applied for a voter card 
citing Vittalbhai Patel House as his address: the EC rejected this, saying it was his office, not his residence. Subsequently, he gave an 
address in BK Dutt Colony that the EC accepted. But the Congress has told the EC that this, too, is an AAP office.
