The EC’s warning to the AAP supremo came on a day when both the AAP’s political rivals, the BJP and the Congress, demanded that Mr Kejriwal's 
nomination be cancelled. If the BJP slammed Mr Kejriwal for “defaming” the party by accusing it of bribing voters, the Congress said he had “cheated” the people by 
declaring a false address in his nomination papers'.
But if the Congress and the BJP have mounted an offensive against the AAP, Janata Dal-United chief Sharad Yadav last week came to his 
defence, saying Mr Kejriwal was just warning voters against the use of money power and that the EC’s censure notice was “unjustified”.
Evidently, Mr Kejriwal’s AAP is mounting a formidable challenge in the Delhi assembly elections, enough for the BJP and the Congress to 
take him seriously. Indeed, this is despite the fact that these parties had publicly written him off, saying that anyone who quit as 
chief minister after 49 days was unlikely to win the people’s trust again.
