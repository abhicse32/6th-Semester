After the ‘Make In India’ aimed at the manufacturing industry, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is all set to launch a big push to the services
sector in April.
Mr. Modi will inaugurate a global exhibition on services on April 23 to showcase India’s strength in the sector and provide platform to the 
industry to explore business opportunities, Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Seetharaman said in New Delhi on Tuesday. “Services must
grow alongside manufacturing as the services sector contributes over 50 per cent in the country's economic growth.”
Over 40 countries are expected to participate in the three-day exhibition, the Minister told reporters. Besides IT, big opportunities exist
in other sectors such as tourism, wellness, yoga, healthcare, education, logistics, media and entertainment, R&D, space and hospitality, 
she said.
