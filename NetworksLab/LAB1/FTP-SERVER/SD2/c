China on Tuesday announced plans hold a major military parade and will be inviting Russian President Vladimir Putin. Departing from a 
practice of conducting such events once in a decade, China will hold the military parade this year in Beijing to celebrate the 70th 
anniversary of the victories of World War II, state media reported.
China will tighten security for the event, Fu Zhenghua, chief of the Beijing Public Security Bureau was quoted as saying by China-org.cn.
The Chinese Foreign Ministry has confirmed that Russian state leaders will attend the war commemoration, making this the first time that 
foreign state leaders will attend a Chinese military parade.
China usually holds a military parade every 10 years to celebrate the founding of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China in 1949. The most recent 
parade was held in 2009.
