The judge also asked Jayalalithaa’s counsel to substantiate the savings of Rs. 95 lakh mentioned in the tabulated paper submitted before the court. 
“You have submitted the tabulated paper relating to the Rs. 95 lakh savings but does not substantiate the claim,” he said.
As soon as the Special Bench began the third week of the hearing, Kumar submitted that the six companies in contention were in no way owned by Jayalalithaa but she is a mere shareholder as others. “Jayalalithaa has nothing to do with these six companies in contention. She is, like others, a mere shareholder, not an owner,” he contended.
An apex court bench, headed by Chief Justice H L Dattu, had ordered that the hearing in the High Court on the appeal, filed by Jayalalithaa challenging her conviction and sentence in the case, be conducted on a day—to—day basis.
