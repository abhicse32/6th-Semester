A Special Bench of the Karnataka High Court on Tuesday rapped former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa’s counsel for “wasting” its time by making “impertinent” submissions before it in the appeals filed by her and three others, challenging their conviction in the disproportionate assets case. “Do not waste the time of the court by making impertinent submissions in the case. Give specific replies to my specific questions,” Justice Kumaraswamy said. The Special Bench has been set up after the Supreme Court had on December 18 last directed the Chief Justice of Karnataka High Court to constitute it to decide Jayalalithaa’s plea within three months. 
Justice Kumaraswamy also said he was not an auditor and an expert in financial matters and hence, requested B. Kumar, Jayalalithaa’s counsel, to make pertinent submissions. “I am neither a financial expert nor an auditor. Please respond to my pertinent queries,” he said.
