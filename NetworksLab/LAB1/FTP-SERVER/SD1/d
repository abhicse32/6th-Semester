Mr. Obama had visited India early in his tenure and was upbeat when he talked about India and the U.S. developing “a defining partnership 
for the 21st century” but there has been little to show for it since. The ambiguities of India’s Nuclear Liability Act, the Defence Minister
of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA), A.K. Antony’s ability to stonewall proposals for closer ties, the retroactive tax policy 
announcements and the economic slowdown in India, coupled with Mr. Obama’s other growing preoccupations, both domestic and foreign, meant 
that the partnership was languishing.
Looking around for legacy issues in the foreign policy area, Mr. Obama knew that India enjoyed the advantage of bipartisan support in 
Washington which was not the case with Cuba and Iran. Mr. Modi had understood this and rightly concluded that for India-U.S. ties,
Mr. Obama’s lame-duck standing of being in his last stretch in the White House was inconsequential. The show at the Madison Square Garden 
in New York had shown the American people Mr. Modi’s power in galvanising the Indian-American diaspora, three million strong and emerging
 as a significant fund raiser for the 2016 American election. But before 2016, India had to be brought back into U.S. reckoning. This 
 needed a political pitch, between leaders who had won elections against all odds, and Mr. Modi was willing to make that pitch.
