The momentous victory of the radical left-wing Syriza party in Greece is certain to send shock waves through Brussels, already trying to contend with the rising popularity of forces lined up against the European Union. The impact will be felt most notably in Spain and Britain, where elections are due in weeks. But the outcome of Sunday’s poll would have surprised few in Greece, whose macroeconomic indicators must cause near-disbelief considering that the country is clubbed with the states of the developed world. Nearly a third of the population is below the poverty line and about a quarter of the workforce is jobless. The hundreds of health clinics, social kitchens, education centres and legal aid hubs that sprang up in recent months testify to the collapse of Greece’s welfare state under the weight of half a decade of austerity. It is this Solidarity for All movement that constitutes the backbone of Syriza’s political programme that swung its fortunes: from being the principal Opposition in the outgoing government it has become the largest party in the new Parliament.
