Everybody was confident that U.S. President Barack Obama’s visit would be a good and successful one. There was enough in terms of symbolism
to ensure that the following would have ensured a “good visit” — the first U.S. President to be the chief guest at the Republic Day; the 
first U.S. President to visit India twice during his tenure; the ceremony of the Republic Day parade notwithstanding the inclement weather;
the excitement about the menu at the banquet the previous day; the buzz surrounding First Lady Michelle Obama’s outfits. The question was 
whether it would be a great visit, and a historic visit. Clearly, Prime Minister Narendra Modi wanted it that way and he has successfully 
put his imprint on India-U.S. relations.
The fact that he has done so in less than a year of his becoming Prime Minister provides us an insight into his thinking. His pragmatism 
was evident when he put the decade-long “visa ban” issue behind him and readily accepted Mr. Obama’s invitation to visit Washington in 
September last year. The U.S. too was signalling that the India-U.S. file had regained importance after the general election and that it 
was departing from the norm that bilateral visits did not normally take place when leaders were visiting New York for the U.N. General 
Assembly. It was evident that the two leaders connected. Mr. Modi was able to convince Mr. Obama about his vision for India and his belief
that it needed a strong partnership with the U.S. which he could deliver on.
